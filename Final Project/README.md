World Religion Visualization


Background.  
My project is a five-tab visualization that now lives on Tableau Public. The project is an attempt to bring life to a simple yet abstract dataset. It is about getting the user to interact with and to explore the data on their own terms and with their own objectives and curiosities.


The big question(s).  
Religion. There are major ones, minor ones, sects, denominations, and nearly 200 hundred countries. Most of the world’s population has some type of religious or spiritual affiliation. Where are they? How are they distributed – locally, regionally? Are there any the trends? Questions abound.


Dataset.  
The data comes from the Association of Religion Data Archives. The dataset is not that big at a dimension of 35 x 1996 and it comes in a fairly clean state. The set combines survey data from 1950 – 2010 in 5-year increments.


Approach.  
Tab 1 and tab 2 use line graphs for time series analysis.  
Tab 3 and tab 4 use world maps to explore the distributions and allows for some part-to-whole analysis.  
Tab 5 uses a fine-tooth comb (tabular and numeric) to get some very specific country level proportion details – bar graphs are used here.  
Overall, there’s simplicity, consistency, and plenty of details on demand (tooltips) throughout the viz.
