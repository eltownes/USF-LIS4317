Animation Visualization


Using gganimate


This visualization uses R's gapminder{gapminder} dataset. The dataset is faceted by continent with each dot representing a country. Each graph presents several attributes on a loop that cycles from the years 1952 to 2007 in 4 year increments. The variables presented are GDP per capita (x-axis [log scale]), life expectancy (y-axis), and population size (dot size).


In general, we see a positive slope for all continents. Starting around the 1990s, the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the African continent can be seen - quite some precipitous drops in the life expectancy for some countries. In Asia we see a few very large countries. Lastly, Europe has the tightest grouping at the high end of both life expectancy and GDP per Capita.
