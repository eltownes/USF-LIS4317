Visual Differences and Deviation Analysis



Florida Counties Relative Health Importance

This is a visualization from the Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) data set. This particular indicator domain has been filtered for Florida counties and still contains 1474 data points covering 22 unique variables for 66 counties.

With so many data points, the heat map provides a quick way to spot differences and compare across multiple variables. One thing that isnâ€™t apparent by perusing the data set but that the visualization brings out, is the clustering of missing or non-reported data.

The .csv file was obtained from healthdata.gov, analyzed in RStudio and then modified in Adobe Illustrator.

The code and data file can be obtained from GitHub @ https://github.com/eltownes/USF-LIS4317/tree/master/Module%206
