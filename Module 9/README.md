Multivariate Analysis Using corrgram and lattice



Multivariate analysis allows us to consider the effects that various variables may have on another condition. For brevity, I just considered two variables with a focus on design principles.



The five basic principles of design include alignment, repetition, contrast, proximity, and balance. This two-page assignment includes all of these principles except for contrast.



The two pages show repetition by title (Birth Weights) and usage of somewhat consistent graphs (histograms). Page one shows asymmetrical balance with some usage of vertical and horizontal alignment. Also, page one shows visual connection through proximity by placing the legend near the correlation diagram. Page two clearly shows symmetrical balance with alignments.
